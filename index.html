		<div class="info">
			<p class="fact">Slowpoke uses its tail to catch prey by dipping it in water at the side of a river. However, it often forgets what it's doing and often spends entire days just loafing at water's edge.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span>Species</span>: Dopey Pokémon</li>
				<li><span>Height</span>: 3′11″ (1.19m)</li>
				<li><span>Weight</span>: 79.4 lbs (36.0 kg)</li>
				<li><span>Behavior</span>: rather dumb and it rarely moves</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="about">Slowpoke can have the abilities Oblivious or Own Tempo. Oblivious prevents Slowpoke from being infatuated. Own Tempo prevents Slowpoke from being confused. Although slow, Slowpoke is skilled at fishing with its tail, and it does not feel pain if its tail is bitten. It is also implied that their tails can grow back if it is cut off or removed (either during battle, fishing, and/or occasionally by human's).</p>
